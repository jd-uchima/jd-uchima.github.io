	<h2>About the program</h2>
	
	<p id="about_body_copy">
	The NFHS Network School Broadcast Program (SBP) makes it easy for students to produce live video broadcasts by providing the software, tools and training they need for free. With our proprietary technology, schools can produce and distribute high quality events throughout the year including regular season sports, graduation, band, cheer events, as well as other school activities. Broadcasting these events on the NFHS Network is a great way for a school to showcase its students and activities while strengthening the connection with parents, players, boosters and the community. The platform allows both live streaming and archiving for on-demand viewing. Your fans will be able to watch your events whenever they want, wherever they are. Becoming part of the NFHS Network School Broadcast Program is free and you can get started with as little as a camera, a laptop, and an Internet connection.
